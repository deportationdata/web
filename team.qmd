<div class="team-name"><img src="img/hausman.jpg" width=250 align="right" class="team-headshot">**David Hausman, Faculty Director** [Website](https://www.david-hausman.com)</div>

David is an assistant professor of law at Berkeley. He studies immigration enforcement, with a focus on data transparency. His work draws on the combination of a background in quantitative methods and litigation experience at the ACLU, where he worked as an attorney challenging the first Trump administration’s immigration policies. While at the ACLU, he gained knowledge of enforcement data that he now uses in his research, conducting depositions of officials who maintain databases at ICE and the Department of Justice. He has conducted data analysis as a consulting expert in numerous immigrants’ rights cases. He has also published scholarly research using these datasets, evaluating, for example, the effect of sanctuary policies (*Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*), the effect of an algorithmic no-release policy (*Journal of Law and Economics*, forthcoming), the effect of the first Trump administration’s efforts to control the immigration courts (*Journal of Law, Economics and Organization*), and the effect of appeals on immigration court outcomes (*University of Pennsylvania Law Review*). He received his J.D. and Ph.D. in political science from Stanford University and clerked for Judge Stephen Williams on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
